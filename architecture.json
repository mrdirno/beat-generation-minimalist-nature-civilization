  "cover_prompt": "A lone man in worn flannel stands over a wounded stranger in a shallow, rushing river, his face a mask of conflicted mercy against the indifferent flow, set within a vast, mist-shrouded wilderness of pine and cold granite at dawn. The scene is rendered with the stark, existential minimalism and textured, ink-wash aesthetic of a beat generation sketchbook, evoking the raw, unforgiving poetry of nature and silent human drama. The composition is a tight, centered book cover frame with a low, dramatic angle that makes the river's current feel immense and the figures isolated, capturing the pivotal moment of decision. The lighting is a cold, diffuse dawn glow with a palette of slate grays, deep pine greens, and the bruised purple of fading night, punctuated only by the stark white of the stranger's shirt and the muted ochre of the man's jacket. masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev"
